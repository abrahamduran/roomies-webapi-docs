# Getting Started

This is where it all begins...

The Roomies RESTful API is here! The idea behind this API is to help us manage our financial
headaches in a more automated way. This WebAPI will:

- Manage **expenses**
- Manage **payments**
- Aid in the **distribution** of expenses
- Let you quickly see your **balance**
- Keep **track** of the expenses and payments, where's the money going?

Some ideas for the future are:

- Support login/signup
- Notify members when an expense in registered for them
- Notify members when a payment has been made to them
